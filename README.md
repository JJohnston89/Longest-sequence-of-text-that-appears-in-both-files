# Longest-sequence-of-text-that-appears-in-both-files
This is a class project from Analysis of Algorithms course. 

This is the project description that was given: write a program that takes two text files (each having at most 5000 
characters, though if you are able to do larger, feel free to do so) and 
find the longest sequence of text that appears in both files.

Example.
File 1: abcdefg

File 2: dabczzzzzz

The answer is abc

Analyze the O() running time of your algorithm and demonstrate it on 
several example inputs of varying length (report the actual run time for 
each).

Bonus: Implement two different algorithms and compare the running times (in 
theory and in practice).

Super Bonus: Input two text files and find the shortest "marker": a string 
that appear in one file but not the other.
